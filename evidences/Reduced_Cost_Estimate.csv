Rationale:,,,,,,,,
"First, In order to save costs I change the EC2 and RDS instances from a pay-as-you-go to a convertible reserved without upfront payment for 1 year scheme, with only this adjustment the cost was dropped from 9,425.66USD to 7,009.07USD, now with a shorter margin to adjust I analyzed that the EC2 instances were primarily for solving http request (web-server and app-server), so CPU and memory are important, and storage is meant only for OS and not transactional, so provisioned IOPS were not of impact, so I changed such storage for a general purpose SSD (gp2) and with this the cost was dropped to 5,707.07 USD",,,,,,,,
