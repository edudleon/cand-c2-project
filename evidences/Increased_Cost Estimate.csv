Rationale:,,,,,,,,
"In order to increase redundancy, I decided to add a third AZ and have a better load distribution between the resources. Additional to this, I decided to upgrade the RDS instances to a db.r5.4xlarge with SSD Provisioning IOPS (5000) for a better I/O performance With this I was happy, but I decided to go for a regional backup for disaster recovery, so resources were doubled on the bill with one adjustment, the sizes of the EC2 and RDS instances in the backup zone were reduced to c5.4xlarge and db.r5.2xlarge respectively, as they are not going to be operative, but selected them as convertible reserved instances, so in a case of DR we can promote the instances and if traffic is high have the capacity of scale",,,,,,,,
